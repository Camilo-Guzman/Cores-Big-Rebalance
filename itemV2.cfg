Some of the reworks include a banner ult for Handmaiden, Prayers that cost Fury for Warrior Priest and a Zealot that doesnt have to eat an overhead at the start of the map.

Link to the  [url=https://discord.gg/PeKynGQ] Discord [/url] with all the changes and where you can leave feedback. Would post the docs directly but steam doesnt like that.";
